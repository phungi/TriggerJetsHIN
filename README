This is my workflow to draw jet l1 turn-on curves using condor
./Setup_CMSSW.sh
./Setup_FileLocation.sh to set the path to the Ntuples
./SubmitJobs.sh, this creates input for condor, Step1.condor, with executable StepProcess.sh (default example runs Plot_Final_datacalo_JEC.C)
condor_submit Step1.condor launches the jobs, one per ntuple file

Plot_Final_datacalo_JEC.C is an example that runs on data, and calculates trigger efficiency for calo jets. If jec_correct==1, then MC-based corrections are applied to the calo jet pT. The correction files (.txt) must be updated, these two files were 
derived privately for tests) 
Plot_Final_MCppcalo_new_JEC.C is an example that runs on pp MC. 


Two plotting example macros: plotResults_PbPb_data.C or plotResults_pp_summaryJec.C 


Molly_script is the script I run on condor (or if the dataset is small, you can combine the L1 ntuples and run it locally) -- it is an amalgamation of Leticia's and Molly's scripts (which do pretty much the same thing). It also includes jetID and alternative matching (highest pt within dR instead of closest).
